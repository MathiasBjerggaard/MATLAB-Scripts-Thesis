# MATLAB-Scripts-Thesis
Matlab scripts used for analysis and for simulations in my masters thesis. 

All scripts are made to be used for a single project, and should not be used in other situations without heavy adjustments. This code is not written to be efficient, nor to be applicable to multiple situations, but are written to be a fast analysis tool for my uses.

SCRIPTS:
  Cyl_extract, Extraction of results for cylindrical results from simulations. Comments in Danish.
  Edge_2D, Extraction of results for 2D target diffusion code for edge-released proteins. Comments partially in Danish.
  Extract_2d, Extraction of results for 2D target diffusion code for uniformly released proteins. Comments partially in Danish. 
  Extract_3d, Extraction of results for 3D Smoluchowski targets, uniformly and edge released proteins. Comments in Danish.
  OneDimensionalSimulation, Simulation and analysis of the 1D case for protein target diffusion. Comments in Danish.
